summary: "The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter
  templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and
  teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site\r

  The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs. Itâ€™s a good
  platform for anyone looking to take control of their data and online identity
  whilst having the convenience to start off with a no-code solution (write in
  Markdown and customize with YAML parameters) and having flexibility to later
  add even deeper personalization with HTML and CSS\r

  You can work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of plugins
  and integrations to speed up your workflows, interact with your readers, and
  much more"
